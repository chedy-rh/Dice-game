# How to play
Roll the die.

If you roll 2–6:

Add that number to your turn total.

You can now choose to Roll again or Hold.

If you Hold:

Add your turn total to your overall score.

Your turn ends, and the next player goes.

If you roll a 1:

Pig out! Your turn total becomes 0, and you lose your turn.

No points are added to your overall score.

The first player to reach 100 or more points wins!

If a player reaches 100 during their turn, the game ends immediately — they win.
